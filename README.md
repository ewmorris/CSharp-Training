# CSharp-Training
Repository for training in C#

We will be learning to code in C#.Net. For the class I will be using the following software:

1. Visual Studio: the free version can be found at: 
    https://www.visualstudio.com/post-download-vs/?sku=community&clcid=0x409&downloadrename=true#

2. After installation you can download the github extention at:
    https://visualstudio.github.com/

    This will allow an easy connection to github to use the information and code here.
    
3. Sql Server Management Studio: optional as Visual Studio has something similar built in, but very useful:
